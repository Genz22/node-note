# HOW TO JOIN MARS TESTNET

`chain-id = ares-1`

## Hardware Requirements

A production-ready server typically requires:
- 8-core x86 CPU. Cosmos apps do compile on ARM chips (e.g. Apple's M1 processor) but the reliability is not battle-tested. Notably, chains that incorporate the CosmWasm module won't even compile on ARM servers.

- 64 GB RAM. Cosmos apps typically use less than 32 GB under normal conditions, but during events such as chain upgrades, up to 64 GB is usually needed.

- 4 TB NVME SSD. Hard drive I/O speed is crucial! Validators who run on HDD or SATA SSD often find themselves missing blocks. Requirements on disk space depends on the chain and your pruning settings but generally at least 2 TB is recommended. 

- Linux operating system.
